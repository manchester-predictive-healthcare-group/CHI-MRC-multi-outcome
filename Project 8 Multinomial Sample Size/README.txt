Code for manuscript

All R code directories are relative to a root directory, which is the data and materials folder. Either start an R project file where the root directory is positioned here, or add a line at the top of every piece of code with a current directory command: "cd('INSERT PATH TO DIRECTORY HERE')".

p1 files calculate the required sample sizes for each scenario, and the proportion of each outcome category for the different scenarios

p2 files run the simulation and produce the results

p3 files run through the worked example

p4 files are supplementary material, not presented in the manuscript

Description: A toolbox to aid in the estimation of calibration plots for 
  multistate models which have been developed. Calibration of the transition 
  probabilities at time t when in state j at time s are assessed. This is done 
  using a combination of landmarking, calibration methods for binary logistic 
  and multinomaial logistic regression models and inverse probability of 
  censoring weights.

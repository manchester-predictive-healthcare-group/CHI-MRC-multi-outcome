\description{
Creates the underlying data for the calibration plots. Observed event
probabilities at time \code{t.eval} are estimated for inputted predicted
transition probabilities \code{tp.pred} out of state \code{j} at time \code{s}.
\code{calc_calib_mlr} estimates calibration scatter plots using a multinomial logistic
framework in combination with landmarking and inverse probability of
censoring weights.

Two datasets for the same cohort of inidividuals must be provided. A \code{msdata}
format dataset generated using the \code{mstate} package. A \code{data.frame} with one
row per individual, relevant variables for estimating the weights, and a time
until censoring varaible (\code{dtcens}) and indicator (\code{dtcens.s}). Weights are
estimated using a cox-proportional hazard model and assuming linear
functional form of the variables defined in \code{w.covs}. We urge users to
specify their own modwl for estimating the weights. Confidence intervals for
the calibration scatter plots cannot be produced as it is currently unclear how
to present such data.

\title{Plot calibration scatter plots}
\usage{
\method{plot}{calib_mlr}(x, ..., combine = TRUE, ncol = NULL, nrow = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object of type 'calib_mlr' generated from calc_calib_mlr}

\item{...}{Other}

\item{combine}{Whether to combine into one plot using ggarrange, or return as a list of individual plots}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns for combined calibration plot}

\item{nrow}{Number of rows for combined calibration plot}
}
\description{
Creates calibration plots for the transition probabilities of a multistate model
using data estimated from \code{calc_calib_mlr}. Such data was estimated using the
multinomial logistic regression framework with inverse probability of censoring weights.

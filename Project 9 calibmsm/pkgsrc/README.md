## Summary

A toolbox to aid in the estimation of calibration plots for multistate
models which have been developed. Calibration of the transition
probabilities at time t when in state j at time s are assessed. This is
done using a combination of landmarking, calibration methods for binary
logistic and multinomaial logistic regression models and inverse
probability of censoring weights.

## Installation

The package can be installed from CRAN as follows:

``` r
install.packages("calibmsm")
```

## Development version

You can install the development version of predRupdate from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with::

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("manchester-predictive-healthcare-group/CHI-MRC-multi-outcome/tree/main/Project%209%20calibmsm/pkgsrc")
```
